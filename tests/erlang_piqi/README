Compile complex Piqi specification "piqi/piqi.piqi" to produce Erlang coders
and decoders.

Then build a program that reads and writes back a serialized binary object that
happens to be the serialized "piqi.piqi" specification itself.

Also testing Piqi imports in Erlang by compiling and linking "piqobj.piqi" which
imports "piqi.piqi".
